    * tag asd-Heracles-UNSTABLE-MAM+ACI-a3: changed the interface 
    of modal_aero_amicphys_intr() to return the column-integrated
    tendencies due to gas-aerosol-exchange/condensation, rename,
    nucleation and coagulation

    * added automatically generated exports of the column-integrated 
    tendencies due to microphysics process; need a better way of mapping 
    the diagnostics from the modal_aero_amicphys_intr() to the exported
    fields

    * added MAM7_ExtData.rc and GEOSachem_ExtData.rc

    * added the code and scripts that generate the mie-optics LUTs 
    in the 'optics' subdirectory

    * upstream edits from Heracles-UNSTABLE


2015-11-12  Anton Darmenov  <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov>
    * tag asd-Heracles-UNSTABLE-MAM+ACI-a2: do not use code from the 
    ./CAM directory; 

    * the old implementations of the coagulation, 
    nucleation and gas-aerosol-exchange parameterizations 
    in MAML_CoagulationMod.F90 and MAM_CoagulationMod.F90, 
    MAML_NucleationMod.F90 and MAM_NucleationMod.F90, 
    MAML_GasAerosolExchangeMod.F90 and MAM_GasAerosolExchangeMod.F90 are not
    needed anymore because these processes are now done in 
    the modal_aero_amicphys_intr() subroutine

    * synced with upstream edits from Heracles-UNSTABLE (radiation, moist, etc)


2015-10-30  Anton Darmenov  <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov>

    * tag asd-Heracles-UNSTABLE-MAM+ACI-a1: adapted improvements updates to 
    MAM and MOSAIC from PNNL and cherrypicked files from CESM to GEOS-5; export
    AERO_ACI state with a method to calculate volume-averaged aerosol 
    activation properties; the tag passes the regression test.
