# Ask a question about HEMCO

To report a GEOS HEMCO bug or technical issue, please use [this issue template](https://github.com/geoschem/hemco/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=report-a-bug-or-technical-issue.md&title=%5BBUG%2FISSUE%5D) instead.

Please keep in mind that the [GEOS-Chem Support Team](http://wiki.geos-chem.org/GEOS-Chem_Support_Team) focuses primarily on software development and user support rather than on scientific research. If your question is more scientific in nature (e.g. "What happens if I change this reaction rate from X to Y?", or "Is emissions inventory A better than inventory B?", etc.), then we recommend that you contact the relevant [GEOS-Chem Working Group(s)](http://www.geos-chem.org/geos_working_groups.html) for assistance.
