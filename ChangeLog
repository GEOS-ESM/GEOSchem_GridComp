    * Updated cloudnew.F90 GEOS_MoistGridComp.F90 to Heracles-5_2;
      this effecively makes this tag to be based on Heracles-5_2;
      next GEOS_MoistGridComp.F90 was updated to Andrea's 1-moment mods
      related to the conv/large scale partitiong (tag b_AMM_H521MOPS_move2d)
  
2016-05-27 <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov> Tag: AeroChem-Heracles-5_2-b7
    * GOCART: Initially this tag had the edits related to the modified 
      temperature dependence of the wet removal efficiency factors that 
      used a linear ramp rather than a step function. The edits were in
      SU_GridCompMod.F90, ConvectionMod.F90 and WetRemovalMod.F90 
      (see asd-wet_dep-temperature_ramp tag). However, the results from 
      a test run showed noticeable changes in the AOD, so these edits 
      were reverted in CVS and in this tag until another more 'cleaner' 
      test is done to assess the impact of these edits.

2016-04-17 <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov> Tag: AeroChem-Heracles-5_2-b5

      not properly filled in the single-moment cloud microphysics.
    * Upstream edits from Heracles-UNSTABLE.

2016-04-08 <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov> Tag: AeroChem-Heracles-5_2-b4

      at T < 258K (snow) to 0.
    * Set the HNO3 read from the monthly files to 0.20*GMI_NH3

      properly filled.

2016-03-15 <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov> Tag: AeroChem-Heracles-5_2-b2
    * Replaced CNV_QC (which contrary to the description in the export 
      spec is NOT convective condensate) with the sum of water and ice
      mass fractions of convective cloud (QLCN + QICN)
    * Fixed large scale wet removal when the model is run with the 
      2-moment cloud microphysics: replaced PFL_LSAN and PFI_LSAN with 
      DQRL (which is filled by the single- and two-moment cloud microphysics)
    * HNO3 from GMI was scaled down by an additional factor of 2.5. This results
      in HNO3 wich is equal to 0.17*HNO3_GMI.
    * Updated volcanic emissions to v7.
    * Apply (rather than omitting) emissions from volcanoes that are 
      below the 'surface' model layer.

      include NH3 emissions so in the MERRA2 setup for years 1996-2000 
      for now we rely on QFED climatology); the anthropogenic NH3 
      emissions are from EDGAR-v4.2.

      specified by the user.

          CFC12SLS and CFC12TLS are m^{-3}s^{-1}.

2014-03-14 <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov> , Tag asd-Ganymed-4_0_BETA10-a1
	* Synced asd-Ganymed-4_0_BETA9-a2 with upstream edits from Ganymed-4_0_BETA10.

2014-03-12 <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov> , Tag asd-Ganymed-4_0_BETA9-a2

	* Updated volcanic emissions to version 4.
	* Dust optical tables were updated to version 14.2

2014-02-06 <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov> , Tag asd-Ganymed-4_0_BETA8-a1
	* Changes implemented by Pete:
    1) Support for multiple instances of BC. BC_GridComp.rc 
    is changed to specify regional tags, and introduce BC_GridComp---full.rc 
    as analog to SU_GridComp—full.rc.  This change required updates as well to 
    GOCART_GridCompMod.F90 and Aero_GridCompMod.F90 to support handling of 
    optics for multiple BC instances. GOCART variable name checking was 
    more specific so that only the 'full' instances of BC and OC are put 
    in Aero bundle for radiation (and only SO4 and SO4v for sulfate). 
    Presumes full tracer names are OC(BC)PHILIC/PHOBIC.
    2) Updated SU_GridCompMod.F90 to permit volcanic data tables to include 
    also start time and end time for eruption emissions (required update to 
    SulfateChemDriverMod.F90). Also made change to add diagnostic calculation of 
    aerosol surface area (for StratChem). Finally, name handling for multiple 
    instances was improved so that volcanic instance (volc) is treated uniquely 
    whereas all other tags (which would nominally be regional/emission specific) 
    are given same names as tropospheric (full) tag. This is needed for 
    radiation diagnostics in module. Also made a small change in Chem_MieMod.F90 
    to accommodate more robust handling of multiple SU instance naming.
    3) Updated CARMA to latest, including coupling to GOCART SU as source of 
    gas H2SO4. Most changes relevant to sulfate simulation.

    This tag as well as the base tag Ganymed-4_0_BETA8 include setling of OC, BC and
    SU aerosols.

2014-02-04 <anton.s.darmenov@nasa.gov> , Tag asd-G4U-RRTMG-AeroState-r2
	* Mods for AERO state - work in progress. This is an intermediate tag 
	  based on Matt's 'Ganymed-4_0_UNSTABLE-RRTMGPU-withPGIedits'. 
	  The new Aero state code is run alongside the existing Aero bundle 
	  code for testing peroses.
	  The tag is zero-diff to Matt's tag if the Aero state is passive in 
	  in solar.

	  locations in fvInput; Fixed reading of Edgar-4.x non-climatological files;

	* b5 was intermediary where we introduced the made the GOCART
	  aerosols unfriendly to MOIST and used the offline convective
	  scavenging code to do both convective mixing and scavenging.
	  This is applied for all aerosols DU/BC/SS/SU/OC under GOCART.
	* b6 maintains this but also changes the name of the offline
	  scavenging module to be more consistent with other stuff
	  under Chem_Shared.
	* b6 also brings major changes under the hood to CARMA
	* TO DO: tune GOCART aerosols for new scavengin
	         bring BC/OC/SS/DU/SU code back to trunk (on branch for now)
	         update to recent changes in GMI (requires new restart for

	  bundle tested and available for radiation.  Note: you must fit

	  optical tables read correctly. This includes filling
	  Chem_MieRegistry.rc with correct number of tracers and names
	  (e.g., doing_DU = YES and provide CARMA type names).  NOTE
	  ALSO: there are numbers hard coded in radiation (see
	  MAX_NUM_RADIUS in GEOS_SolarGridComp.F90 and
	  GEOS_IrradGridComp.F90 and the associated sorad.F90 and
